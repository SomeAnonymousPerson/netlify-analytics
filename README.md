# netlify-analytics

## Process
1. Sketched some components with Pen & Paper to structure my thoughts.
2. Produced a [high level wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51401041/58946824-b5e1fd80-8754-11e9-9ecf-d86fc53853c2.jpg) in Sketch.

## Assumptions
1. This would live under https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics

## Questions I asked
**Q. Since this fictional project would live on the would on netlify.com, should I reuse the same visual cues (ex. buttons styling, images drop shadow, etc) as much as possible?**

A. There is often a lot of ambiguity in a company like Netlify and we get to invent and test out what works best.  Sometimes we will have very fixed scope projects and some projects we need to collaborate together to find the best approach.  This project falls in the latter situation.  Matching what we have is a solid safe bet.  If you feel inspired to suggest something different and the approach helps us get to a better place, so much the better.
